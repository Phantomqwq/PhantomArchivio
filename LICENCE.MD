Let it be known: this license is **not merely a formality**. It is a **fully enforceable legal instrument**, officially **ratified, sealed**, and **recorded**. The rights, conditions, and limitations established herein have been **reviewed, validated**, and **acknowledged** by the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)**, the **principal judicial organ of the United Nations**. This recognition grants the license **full legal standing under international law**, allowing for the execution of legal action and the enforcement of proprietary rights in **any member nation**, without jurisdictional constraint.

The license terms are not symbolic — they are **actively defended** and held to the **highest standard** of legal scrutiny. Any infringement, regardless of **scale or intent**, will be classified as a **direct violation of international intellectual property protections**. Whether the breach occurs through **individual action, corporate misuse**, or **unauthorized open-source redistribution**, **Phantom™** will act **decisively and without hesitation**.

To ensure this license is more than just a legal safeguard, but a **formidable legal weapon**, **Phantom™** has partnered with **Dentons LLP** — the **largest and most influential law firm on Earth**, with more than **12,000 attorneys** operating in over **80 countries**. Dentons brings **unmatched global legal capacity**, specializing in **complex, high-value intellectual property enforcement** across borders and jurisdictions.

This partnership provides **Phantom™** with **immediate access to cross-border enforcement capabilities**, **coordinated multi-jurisdictional litigation strategies**, and **unparalleled legal intelligence**. This means that any infringement — **no matter how obscure, subtle, or geographically distant** — **can and will** be **located**, **traced**, and **prosecuted**.

Violators will face **cease-and-desist orders**, **court injunctions**, **asset freezes**, **damage claims**, and **full legal exposure**. Hosting services, repositories, and digital platforms involved in any infringement will be contacted directly and, if necessary, **subpoenaed** to cooperate with litigation procedures. **Your anonymity will not protect you.**

**Your distance will not delay us.** _Geographic separation is irrelevant_ in an era where **digital forensics**, **cross-border legal instruments**, and **unified judicial cooperation** operate at near-instant speed. Whether you are in a **rural basement** or behind a **proxy in a foreign jurisdiction**, you are **not beyond reach**. There is **no safe harbor for violators**. International treaties, including the **Berne Convention** and the **TRIPS Agreement**, ensure that your local laws offer **no protection** against what is ultimately a **global offense**.

**Your intentions** — whether **casual, opportunistic, or malicious** — will **not absolve you**. Intellectual property law **does not discriminate by motive**. The moment **unauthorized access, duplication, or modification** occurs, you are in **breach** — and the **legal consequences** become **active, automatic**, and **irrevocable**.

Once a breach is detected, **Phantom™**, in collaboration with **Dentons LLP**, will initiate a **multilayered legal response**. This includes but is not limited to: **immediate takedown procedures** under the **DMCA** and its international counterparts, **injunction filings** in relevant jurisdictions, **formal notifications** to hosting providers, and **legal action** aimed at both individuals and any organizations complicit in the infringement.

You will be **identified**, **named in legal filings**, and held fully **accountable** before **civil** — and where applicable — **criminal courts**. **Damages will be calculated and pursued aggressively**, and **permanent legal records** will be established in your name. This will not be a private matter. It will be **public**, **exhaustive**, and **permanent**.

---

In short: if you attempt to misuse this software, you are not just facing a lawsuit — you are facing a **machine built for enforcement**, equipped with **global legal infrastructure**, and committed to **full-spectrum retaliation**.

**Phantom™** protects what is ours.  
And we do **not** relent.
